# FAF Stack

This repository aims to provide a ready-to-go Docker Compose file to set up a complete FAF stack (or parts of it) with
a single command.

## Structure

The FAF stack uses two directories:

* `config` contains the configuration files for all FAF services
* `data` contains data required or produced by the services

Both directories are excluded by `.gitignore`. In fact, all files and directories are excluded if not explicitly un-ignored within `.gitignore`.

### Configuration

Each service has its own directory within `config`. They usually contain an environment file and/or other configuration
files needed for the service to operate properly. Environment files are loaded by Docker Compose and additional
files/directories may be mounted as volumes (both as specified in `docker-compose.yml`).

The `config` directory does not exist and has to be copied from `config.templates`. After that, it has to be kept in sync
with updates to `config.templates` manually (like when a parameter has been added, renamed or removed).

### Data

Some services need to persist files in volumes, or read files of other services. All volumes are created inside 
the `data` directory.

## Naming

To keep things intuitive and avoid conflicts, all services, network aliases, user names, folder names and environment files follow a
consistent naming.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases) 19.03.5-ce or newer (or [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases))
* [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) v1.24.1 or newer

(It might work with older versions but is not tested on these.)

### Copy configuration template files

    cp -R config.template config
    cp .env.template .env


### Recreate security keys (for production systems)

In folder `config/faf-java-api/pki` replace `private.key` and `public.key` with new keys generated with ssh-keygen.

Hint: Some linux distros generate 3072 bit RSA keys by default (e.g. Arch). 3072 bit is not supported. Please use 2048 bit or 4096 bit key length.  


### Initialize core database

    scripts/init-db.sh
    
This will launch the faf-db and generate the current database scheme.

### Update database schema

    docker-compose run --rm faf-db-migrations migrate

### Start all at once

    docker-compose up -d

### Start a single service

If you start a single service, services it depends on will be started automatically. For instance:

    docker-compose up -d faf-python-server

### Start from local repository

To start a service from your local repository, find its `image` or `build` in the `docker-compose.yml` and change it to:

    build: <path>

Where `<path>` is the path to your local project, for instance `../faf-python-server`.

# Service specific configurations

## Postal

### Create initial user

Once Postal is running, create a user by executing the following command:
```
docker exec -it faf-postal /opt/postal/bin/postal make-user
```

    1. Name: FAF Mautic
    1. Short name: faf-mautic
    1. Mode: Choose what's appropriate
1. Set up the email domain
    1. Go to `Domain` and select `Add your first domain`
    1. Enter the domain name and continue
    1. Follow the instructions to set up the DNS correctly
    1. Click `Check my records are correct` and make sure everything is green
1. Set up an SMTP user for faf-mautic

## Mautic

Make sure you set up Postal first.

### Initial Setup

1. Access Mautic's web interface and follow the instructions until `Email Configuration` 
1. Enter the email configuration
    1. Email handling: `Send immediately`, Mailer transport: `Other SMTP Server`. Enter Server: `faf-postal`, Port: `25`, Encryption: `None`, Authentication mode: `Plain`
    1. Enter `Username` and `Password` as seen in Postal (check the Postal setup instructions above) 
1. Log in with the admin username and password (as created before)
1. Find and open the the `Settings` menu (top right corner)
    1. Configure API access
        1. Go to `Configuration`, then `API Settings`
        1. Set API enabled: `Yes`. If mautic/mautic#5743 is still unresolved, set Enable HTTP basic auth: `Yes`
        1. Click `Apply`
        1. If mautic/mautic#5743 is resolved, in the Settings menu, go to `API Credentials` and set up credentials for `faf-java-api`
        1. If mautic/mautic#5743 is still unresolved, go to `Users` in the settings menu and add a user for `faf-java-api`. Preferably, create a role with proper permissions first.
        1. Delete Mautic's cache, otherwise the API won't work. Delete `data/faf-mautic/html/app/cache`
    1. Configure E-Mail
        1. Go to `Configuration`, then `Email Settings`
        1. Click `Test connection` and expect `Success!`
        1. Click `Send test email` and expect to receive an email in the inbox of your user's email account
        1. Preferably, configure an inbox and configure Bounces, Unsubscribe Requests and Contact Replies
        1. Under `Message Settings`, set Disable trackable urls: `Yes`
        1. Under `Unsubscribe Settings`, set all `Show ...` options to `Yes`
        1. Click `Apply`
    1. Configure Custom Fields
        1. Go to `Custom Fields`
        1. Uncheck all except (Alias): country, preferred_locale

## Grafana

### Initial Setup

1. Log into Grafana using `admin/admin`
1. Add a Prometheus datasource named `Prometheus` at `http://faf-prometheus:9090`
1. Go to global organization settings and change the name from `Main org.` to `Forged Alliance Forever`. This is 
required to enable anonymous access, too.
